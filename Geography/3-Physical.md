### Earth's Structure and Layers 🌎🧱

- The Earth is composed of several layers: the crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core.
- The crust is the outermost layer and is made up of solid rock.
- The mantle is below the crust and is made up of hot, flowing rock.
- The outer core and inner core are the Earth's innermost layers and are made up of dense metals.

### Plate Tectonics and Volcanoes 🌋🌡️

- Plate tectonics is the theory that the Earth's crust is made up of several large plates that move and interact with each other.
- Volcanoes are formed when magma from the mantle rises to the Earth's surface.
- Volcanoes can be destructive, but they can also create new land and provide important resources like geothermal energy.

### Climate and Weather 🌡️🌦️

- Climate is the long-term average weather conditions in a region.
- Weather is the short-term atmospheric conditions in a region.
- Factors that influence climate and weather include temperature, precipitation, wind, and pressure.

### Biomes and Ecosystems 🌲🌵🌳

- Biomes are large regions of the Earth with similar climate, plants, and animals.
- Examples of biomes include forests, deserts, grasslands, and tundra.
- Ecosystems are the interactions between living and nonliving things in a particular place.
- Ecosystems provide important services like air and water purification, nutrient cycling, and habitat for wildlife.
