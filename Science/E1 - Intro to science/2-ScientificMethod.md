Verse 1:
We're gonna talk about a way of learning,
A method that's used for discovering,
It's called the scientific method, and it's true,
It's the way that scientists do what they do.

Chorus:
The scientific method, it's how we explore,
We ask questions and test them, we're never a bore,
We make observations and form hypotheses,
Then test them with experiments, to find our theses.

Verse 2:
The first step is to make an observation,
We use our senses, it's a sensation,
We gather information, it's a clue,
Then we ask questions, what could it be, who knew?

Chorus:
The scientific method, it's how we explore,
We ask questions and test them, we're never a bore,
We make observations and form hypotheses,
Then test them with experiments, to find our theses.

Verse 3:
The second step is to make a hypothesis,
It's an educated guess, not hit or miss,
We predict what will happen, it's a start,
Then we test it out, with all our heart.

Chorus:
The scientific method, it's how we explore,
We ask questions and test them, we're never a bore,
We make observations and form hypotheses,
Then test them with experiments, to find our theses.

Verse 4:
The third step is to conduct an experiment,
It's a test that's done, with every intent,
We change one thing, it's the variable,
And measure the outcome, it's a test that's fair and able.

Chorus:
The scientific method, it's how we explore,
We ask questions and test them, we're never a bore,
We make observations and form hypotheses,
Then test them with experiments, to find our theses.

Verse 5:
The fourth step is to analyze the data,
It's a task that's done, with the greatest beta,
We look for patterns, and what we see,
And we draw conclusions, it's clear as can be.

Chorus:
The scientific method, it's how we explore,
We ask questions and test them, we're never a bore,
We make observations and form hypotheses,
Then test them with experiments, to find our theses.

Outro:
So there you have it, the scientific method,
It's the way that scientists make their bed,
So go and explore, with questions in your head,
And use the scientific method, to make discoveries ahead.
