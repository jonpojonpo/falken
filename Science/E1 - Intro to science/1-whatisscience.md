Verse 1:
Science, science, what do you know?
It's a way of learning that makes us grow.
Observing and testing, using our brains,
Discovering new things and breaking chains.

Chorus:
Science is a journey, come on and take a ride,
We'll explore the world, side by side.
With science as our guide, we'll see things differently,
And learn about the world with curiosity.

Verse 2:
Scientists ask questions, they want to know,
Why things happen and how they flow.
They make hypotheses, and they test them out,
Using evidence, to find what it's all about.

Chorus:
Science is a journey, come on and take a ride,
We'll explore the world, side by side.
With science as our guide, we'll see things differently,
And learn about the world with curiosity.

Verse 3:
Science is everywhere, in everything we do,
From the way we breathe, to the food we chew.
It's in the stars, and in the seas,
In the plants, and in the bees.

Chorus:
Science is a journey, come on and take a ride,
We'll explore the world, side by side.
With science as our guide, we'll see things differently,
And learn about the world with curiosity.

Outro:
So now you know, what science is all about,
It's a way of learning, without a doubt.
So come on, let's explore, and see what we can find,
With science as our guide, we'll expand our minds.
